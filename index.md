###### About Me

I'm **Tony Rossi**, a cybersecurity professional with over **21 years of experience** in vulnerability management, threat modeling, GRC, and entrepreneurship. My journey began in the U.S. Navy, where I built the first cybersecurity program for the submarine force and automated critical tasks using Python and open-source tools. Today, I channel that experience into innovative ventures like **sIQurity AI** and **CyberSmrt**, delivering cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions.

## My Work

### Vulnerability Management
I design and implement automated frameworks to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities across diverse IT environments.

### Threat Modeling
I develop predictive models that analyze threat patterns, helping organizations forecast and mitigate potential risks.

### Governance, Risk, & Compliance (GRC)
I create robust GRC frameworks that align technical operations with regulatory requirements and streamline secure configuration management.

### Entrepreneurial Ventures
I founded **sIQurity AI** and **CyberSmrt** to make advanced cybersecurity accessible and affordable for underserved organizations.
